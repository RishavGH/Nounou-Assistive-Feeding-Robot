# Nounou-Assistive-Feeding-Robot
A simulated ABB IRB 120 arm on Simulink for assitive feeding.

The robotic arm uses a joint space inverse dynamics controller for trajectory following. The trajectory has been designed to imitate the natural arm movement of a human being
while eating with a spoon.

The whole project is detailed in the following pdf:
